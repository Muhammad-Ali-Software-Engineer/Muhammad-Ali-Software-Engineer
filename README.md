## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented **Software Engineering student** at the **University of Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan**, dedicated to crafting efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing digital solutions.

I thrive on **designing intuitive interfaces**, building **responsive web applications**, and continuously learning modern technologies to enhance my development journey. Driven by curiosity and creativity, I enjoy turning ideas into meaningful products that solve real-world problems.

Alongside web development, I’m actively strengthening my programming skills through **Python mini projects**, focusing on file handling, data structures, and problem-solving.

I’m also familiar with **UML Design and Software Modeling**, studied during my **Software Design & Architecture** university course, where I worked on diagrams such as Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, and Collaboration diagrams to visualize and structure software systems effectively.
